# RxSage: AI-Powered Medical Prescription Structuring System

RxSage is an end-to-end AI-powered application built to extract, validate, and structure handwritten or typed medical prescriptions. It uses the latest Generative AI (LLMs), FAISS-based semantic search, and a fully integrated front-end/backend system to minimize hospital queue time, reduce medical errors, and streamline patient experience.

> ðŸ’¡ Developed as a real-world solution for Hospitals with clinical impact, RxSage reduces pharmacy queue times from 7â€“10 minutes to 1â€“2 minutes per patient and improves billing accuracy by 78%.
